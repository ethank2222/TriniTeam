# Multi-Agent Intelligence Platform

**React Frontend**

-   The new React frontend is located in the `my-react-app/` directory.
-   Start your Flask backend as before.
-   In `my-react-app/`, run `npm install` then `npm start` to launch the React app.
-   The React app will connect to the backend for all agent, file, and log operations.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Flask (install with `pip install flask`)

## How to Run

1. Install Flask if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```
2. Start the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

The app serves a minimal `index.html` frontend from the `static/` directory.
